# Cloud Intelligence Dashboards (CUDOS Framework)

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/cid-cmd.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/cid-cmd)

## Welcome to Cloud Intelligence Dashboards (CUDOS Framework) automation repository
This repository contains CloudFormation templates and Command Line tool (cid-cmd) for managing various dashboards provided in AWS Well Architected LAB [Cloud Intelligence Dashboards](https://www.wellarchitectedlabs.com/cost/200_labs/200_cloud_intelligence/).

There are several ways we can manage dashboards:
1. CloudFormation Template (using cid-cmd tool in lambda) 
2. Using cid-cmd tool from command line

We recommend cid-cmd tool via [AWS CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home).

## Troubleshooting 

If you experience unexpected behaviour of the cid-cmd script please run cid-cmd in debug mode 

```bash
cid-cmd -vv [command]
```
    
This will produce a log file in the same directory that were at the tile of launch of cid-cmd. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark:Inspect the produced debug log for any sensitive information and anonymise it.

We encourage you to open [new issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment/issues/new) with description of the problem and attached debug log file.
