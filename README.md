## How to use

1. Launch [AWS CloudShell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/home) or your local shell

    Automation requires Python 3

2. Make sure you have latest pip package installed
    ```bash
    python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
    ```

4. Install CID Python automation PyPI package
    ```bash
    pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd
    ```

5. Deploy the Dashboards
    ```bash
    cid-cmd deploy
    ```
#### Optional Commands

6. Update existing Dashboards

## Troubleshooting 

If you experience unexpected behaviour of the cid-cmd script please run cid-cmd in debug mode 

```bash
cid-cmd -vv [command]
```
    
This will produce a log file in the same directory that were at the tile of launch of cid-cmd. 

:heavy_exclamation_mark:Inspect the produced debug log for any sensitive information and anonimise it.

We encourage you to open [new issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment/issues/new) with description of the problem and attached debug log file.

## Legacy (bash) automation has been moved under [**legacy**](./legacy/) directory
