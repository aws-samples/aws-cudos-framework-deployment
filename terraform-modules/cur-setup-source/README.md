# CID Terraform Module: cur-setup-source

Terraform module to set up a Cost and Usage Report in a source (payer) account
for use in Cost Intelligence Dashboards. The module creates an S3 bucket with the necessary
permissions and configuration to replicate CUR data to the destination/aggregation account.
If you are deploying Cost Intelligence Cashboards for a multi-payer environment, you can
one instance of this module for each payer account.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  profile = "src"
  region  = "us-west-2"
  alias   = "src"
}

provider "aws" {
  profile = "src"
  region  = "us-east-1"
  alias   = "src_useast1"
}

provider "aws" {
  profile = "dst"
  region  = "us-west-2"
  alias   = "dst"
}

provider "aws" {
  profile = "dst"
  region  = "us-east-1"
  alias   = "dst_useast1"
}

# Configure exactly one destination account
module "cur_destination" {
  source = "github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment//terraform-modules/cur-setup-destination"

  source_account_ids = ["1234567890"]
  create_cur         = false # Set to true to create an additional CUR in the aggregation account

  # Provider alias for us-east-1 must be passed explicitly (required for CUR setup)
  # Optionally, you may pass the default aws provider explicitly as well
  providers = {
    aws         = aws.dst
    aws.useast1 = aws.dst_useast1
  }
}

# Configure one or more source (payer) accounts
module "cur_source" {
  source = "github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment//terraform-modules/cur-setup-source"

  destination_bucket_arn = module.cur_destination.cur_bucket_arn

  # Provider alias for us-east-1 must be passed explicitly (required for CUR setup)
  # Optionally, you may pass the default aws provider explicitly as well
  providers = {
    aws         = aws.src
    aws.useast1 = aws.src_useast1
  }
}
```

## Version Locking

For production deployments, you should lock the version of this module to a release tag to better
control when and what updates are made. To specify the release tag to use, append `?ref=VERSION`
to the module source. For example, the following source reference will use the Terraform module
and Cloudformation template from version 0.2.13 of this module:

```
source = "github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment//terraform-modules/cur-setup-source?ref=0.2.13"
```

For a complete list of release tags, visit https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment/tags.

*Note: The same syntax can be used to use pre-release/beta versions by specifying a branch name
instead of a tag name*
