    CloudFormation stack parameters. For the full list of available parameters, refer to
    https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment/blob/main/cfn-templates/cid-cfn.yml.
    For most setups, you will want to set the following parameters:
      - PrerequisitesQuickSight: yes/no
      - PrerequisitesQuickSightPermissions: yes/no
      - QuickSightUser: Existing quicksight user
      - QuickSightDataSetRefreshSchedule: Cron expression to refresh spice datasets daily outside of business hours. Default is 4 AM UTC, which should work for most customers in US and EU time zones
      - CURBucketPath: Leave as default is if CUR was created with CloudFormation (cur-aggregation.yaml). If it was a manually created CUR, the path entered below must be for the directory that contains the years partition (s3://curbucketname/prefix/curname/curname/).
      - OptimizationDataCollectionBucketPath: The S3 path to the bucket created by the Cost Optimization Data Collection Lab. The path will need point to a folder containing /optics-data-collector folder. Required for TAO and Compute Optimizer dashboards.
      - DataBuketsKmsKeyArns: Comma-delimited list of KMS key ARNs ("*" is also valid). Include any KMS keys used to encrypt your CUR or Cost Optimization Data S3 data
      - DeployCUDOSDashboard: (yes/no, default no)
      - DeployCostIntelligenceDashboard: (yes/no, default no)
      - DeployKPIDashboard: (yes/no, default no)
      - DeployTAODashboard: (yes/no, default no)
      - DeployComputeOptimizerDashboard: (yes/no, default no)
