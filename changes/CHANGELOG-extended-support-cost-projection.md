# What's new in Extended Support Cost Projection

## Extended Support Cost Projection - v1.2.0

**Important:** Update to this version requires a forced and recursive update. If you have modified the Extended Support Cost Projection dashboard view queries, they will be overridden when the dashboard is updated. Consider backing-up the existing view queries if they contain custom changes you want to keep so you can re-apply them after the update takes place.

To update run these commands in your CloudShell (recommended) or other terminal:

```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd
cid-cmd update --dashboard-id extended-support-cost-projection --force --recursive
```

You will be presented with the option "proceed and override" to update the RDS and EKS views. Please choose this option to ensure changes to the underlying view queries are applied in your RDS and EKS Extended support views.

- Adding preprocessing for RDS engine versions to simplify release calendar maintenance. Major versions will be used normally except in cases where minor versions are targeted for the extended support.
