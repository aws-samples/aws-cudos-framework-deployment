      <content:encoded>Added support to view Net Amortized Cost in "View Cost As" control in all sheets. Removed "Exclude last 1 month" from all date range controls to prevent "No Data" (because Split Cost Allocation Data for EKS starts filling data only in current month)

        Fixed issue where all split cost and usage metrics were lower than they should be, for pods on EC2 instances that were running for less than a full hour

        Fixed aggregation issues for usage metrics in Athena views</content:encoded>
