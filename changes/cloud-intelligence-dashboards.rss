      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cudos-framework-deployment/blob/rss_feed/changes/CHANGELOG-extended-support-cost-projection.md#extended-support-cost-projection---v310</guid>
      <description>Extended Support Cost Projection Dashboard update to v4.0.0</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
        In this release we have introduced projection of extended support costs for Amazon OpenSearch. The dashboard provides a clear view on OpenSearch and ElasticSearch domains reaching extended support in the next 3, 6, 12 months, and beyond.
        
        Important: This version requires the data collection version 3.2.0+. Update to this version requires a forced and recursive update. If you have modified the Extended Support Cost Projection dashboard view queries, they will be overridden when the dashboard is updated. Consider backing-up the existing view queries if they contain custom changes you want to keep so you can re-apply them after the update takes place.
        To update run these commands in your CloudShell (recommended) or other terminal:

        pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd
        cid-cmd update --dashboard-id extended-support-cost-projection --force --recursive
