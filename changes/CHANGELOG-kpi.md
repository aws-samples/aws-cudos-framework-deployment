# What's new in the KPI Dashboard

## KPI - 2.0.0
> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Update to this version requires cid-cmd v0.2.23. Please update cid-cmd first before updating the dashboard. During the update QuickSight datasets and Athena views will be updated, please make a copy if you've made any customizations. To update run these commands in your CloudShell (recommended) or other terminal:
```
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
pip3 install --upgrade cid-cmd
cid-cmd update --dashboard-id kpi_dashboard --recursive
```
> [!WARNING]
> You will be prompted to override KPI dashboard views and datasets with v2.0.0 versions. It's required to choose **proceed and override** for kpi_instance_all and kpi_tracker views and datasets while you can choose **keep existing** for others. Any customizations done to visuals for which you've selected **proceed and override** will be overwritten hence it's important to save copies of them in case you would like to re-implement them after update. You'll be able to see the diff of the changes before selecting an option.
