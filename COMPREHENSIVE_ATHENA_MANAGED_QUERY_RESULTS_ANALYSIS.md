# AWS Athena Managed Query Results Implementation Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of implementing AWS Athena managed query results in the Cloud Intelligence Dashboards (CID) framework, addressing all stakeholder concerns raised by the AWS team including cost implications, performance considerations, multi-cloud scenarios, and implementation strategy.

## 1. Feature Overview

### What is Athena Managed Query Results?
- **Launch Date**: June 6, 2025 (9 days ago)
- **Availability**: GA in all regions where Athena is available, except GovCloud/ADC and China (coming soon)
- **CloudFormation Support**: ✅ Available (confirmed via documentation analysis)

### Key Benefits
- **Zero Additional Cost**: Query results stored at no charge for 24 hours
- **Automatic Lifecycle Management**: Results automatically deleted after 24 hours
- **Simplified Operations**: No S3 bucket provisioning or management required
- **Enhanced Security**: Results scoped to workgroups instead of S3 buckets
- **Streamlined IAM**: Access controlled via workgroup permissions

## 2. Cost Analysis

### Current Customer-Managed Approach Costs

#### S3 Storage Costs (Monthly)
```
Scenario 1: Small Organization (100 queries/day)
- Average query result size: 10 MB
- Daily storage: 100 × 10 MB = 1 GB
- Monthly storage (30 days): 30 GB
- S3 Standard cost: 30 GB × $0.023/GB = $0.69/month

Scenario 2: Medium Organization (1,000 queries/day)  
- Daily storage: 1,000 × 10 MB = 10 GB
- Monthly storage: 300 GB
- S3 Standard cost: 300 GB × $0.023/GB = $6.90/month

Scenario 3: Large Organization (10,000 queries/day)
- Daily storage: 10,000 × 10 MB = 100 GB  
- Monthly storage: 3,000 GB (3 TB)
- S3 Standard cost: 3,000 GB × $0.023/GB = $69.00/month
```

#### Additional Customer-Managed Costs
- **S3 Request Costs**: PUT/GET requests for query results
- **Data Transfer**: If results accessed from different regions
- **Lifecycle Management**: Lambda functions for cleanup (if implemented)
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics for S3 bucket monitoring
- **Administrative Overhead**: Time spent managing buckets, policies, cleanup

### Managed Query Results Costs
- **Storage Cost**: $0.00 (AWS absorbs the cost)
- **Request Cost**: $0.00 (included in Athena query pricing)
- **Management Cost**: $0.00 (fully managed by AWS)

### **Total Cost Savings: 100% of query result storage and management costs**

## 3. Performance Analysis

### Query Execution Performance
- **No Impact**: Query execution time remains identical
- **Result Retrieval**: Same performance as S3-based results
- **Network Latency**: Results stored in same region as workgroup

### Limitations to Consider
- **24-Hour Retention**: Results automatically deleted after 24 hours
- **200 MB Download Limit**: Console downloads limited (use UNLOAD for larger results)
- **No Query Result Reuse**: Feature doesn't support result caching
- **ODBC 2.x Compatibility**: Requires disabling S3Fetcher configuration

### CID Framework Impact Assessment
✅ **Positive Impact**: All CID queries are for dashboard generation, not long-term storage
✅ **Compatible**: 24-hour retention sufficient for dashboard refresh cycles  
✅ **No Performance Degradation**: Query execution and result retrieval unchanged

## 4. Multi-Cloud and FOCUS Considerations

### Concern: Customer Hesitation with AWS-Managed Storage
**Issue**: Customers using FOCUS dashboards with multi-cloud data may be concerned about AWS managing their query results.

### Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. **Transparency and Control**
```yaml
AthenaQueryResultsMode:
  Type: String
  Default: 'customer-managed'  # Conservative default
  AllowedValues: ["managed", "customer-managed"]
  Description: "Choose query result storage mode. 'managed' uses AWS storage (free, 24h retention), 'customer-managed' uses your S3 bucket (you control, you pay)"
```

#### 2. **Clear Documentation**
- Explicitly document that managed results are temporary (24h)
- Clarify that source data remains in customer's control
- Emphasize that only query results (aggregated data) are temporarily stored by AWS

#### 3. **Gradual Adoption Path**
- Default to customer-managed for backward compatibility
- Allow opt-in to managed mode
- Support mixed environments (some workgroups managed, others customer-managed)

#### 4. **Compliance Considerations**
- **Data Residency**: Results stored in same region as workgroup
- **Encryption**: Results encrypted with customer's choice of keys
- **Access Control**: Results accessible only via workgroup permissions
- **Audit Trail**: All access logged via CloudTrail

### FOCUS-Specific Recommendations
```yaml
# For FOCUS deployments, provide clear choice
Parameters:
  FocusDataSource:
    Type: String
    AllowedValues: ["aws-only", "multi-cloud"]
  
Conditions:
  UseConservativeDefaults: !Equals [!Ref FocusDataSource, "multi-cloud"]

# Default to customer-managed for multi-cloud scenarios
AthenaQueryResultsMode:
  Default: !If [UseConservativeDefaults, "customer-managed", "managed"]
```

```

### 6.2 Performance Testing (Large Dataset Scenarios)
```sql
-- Test with large CUR data (as requested by Petro)
SELECT 
  line_item_usage_account_id,
  product_servicecode,
  SUM(line_item_unblended_cost) as total_cost
FROM cur_table 
WHERE year = '2024' AND month IN ('01','02','03','04','05','06')
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10000;

-- Measure:
-- 1. Query execution time
-- 2. Result retrieval time  
-- 3. Memory usage
-- 4. Network performance
```

### 6.3 QuickSight Integration Testing
