Lambda charges based on the number of requests and aggregate execution time for your function.

Function errors include errors returned by the function''s code and errors returned by the function''s runtime. To help you troubleshoot Lambda errors, Lambda integrates with services like Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray. You can use a combination of logs, metrics, alarms, and X-ray tracing to quickly detect and identify issues in your function code, API, or other resources that support your application.
